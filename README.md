## Description

Maintaining proper posture could be challenging when we forget about it, yet so easy when we remember. This app is a demonstration of a feedback loop that won't disrupt user workflow by 'recommending' standing up every 5 minutes. Insted it gently blurs text on detection of bad posture. 

The app was build using Vue.js and Teachable Machines library which is subset of Tensorflow.js and Vue.js 2 + Vuesax components.

WORK IN PROGRESS
Next versions will provide better AI Model and design.
