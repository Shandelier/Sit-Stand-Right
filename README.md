## Description

Maintaining proper posture could be challenging when forget about it, yet so easy when we remember. This app is a demonstration of a feedback loop that won't disrupt user workflow by 'recommending' standing up every 5 minutes. Insted it gently blurs text making it readable only if user is in proper position. 

The app is build using Vue.js and Teachable Machines library based on TensorFlow.js.

WORK IN PROGRESS
Next versions will provide better AI Model and design.
